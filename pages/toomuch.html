    <h2>The Hunt</h2>
   (Simplicity!) A word that would title my autobiography. One day during my hourly commute to my weekend gig; i spotted a very attractive, tall and black girl getting on the train. Usually, i´d glance and come up with a plan of attack and strike but i was drawing a blank. She was wearing a sweat suit and the curves her body possessed were on full display for my eyes only. The smell of vanilla overtook the car and i was now focused on the capture. Assessing the situation i noticed she didn't look happy at all in fact she look angry. What the hell is her problem i thought, doesn't look like she wants to talk or even be bothered. However, that wasn´t a deterrent to me at all if anything it was more of a catalyst. As the train emptied out at the station before crossing the Brooklyn bridge our eyes met briefly and i got the what the hell you looking at gaze accompanied by the eye roll. Being a natural contrarian i asked her to stop staring at me rather rudely while approaching her slowly: catching her off guard. Insults of me being ugly, not worth staring at, and "how i know what a im staring at you if you´re not staring at me" echoed from her mouth. I simply replied ¨so what if i´m staring at you, i like what i see¨. She smile and i went back to stating the job was done. To my surprise she actually came to sit next to me and a conversation began. While conversing i learned she was from the islands, had lost her mother and father on her birthday.... one year apart. Numbers exchanged, hugs were given and promises of a future meet up were on the horizon. As we parted she asked me if she i thought she was crazy, out of the ordinary. No thinking and being filled with ego i responded ¨No, I´m just that good¨ With hindsight being 20/20, No i am not that good and yes she was crazy.
