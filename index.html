      <h3>A Sneak Peak!</h3>
      <p> A few years back while walking home from a late night shift out in industrial Brooklyn, I was greeted by a man; by name. "Hey Man" I said briefly and rudely brushed him off to catch the last train headed uptown to the Bronx. So what? I know that's what you're thinking. Problem is I don't remember him at all (I have great memory; especially w/ faces). The bigger issue is was that he called me by my government name, which no one uses; not even my parents address me by it.  Perhaps we met at a particular sporting or schooling event, maybe our paths crossed when I was in predator mode, attempting to pull off one of my shenanigans. "Yeah that's it" as I mumbled to myself, that seemed to be the only logical option I could think of.</p>

        Place: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowanus, Brooklyn"> Gowanus, Brooklyn</a>, Time: Weekend <sup>(2nd Shift)</sup>, Why: Money, needed a second job because NYC is hella expensive for a millennial in his early 20's. The Gowanus neighborhood is a very diverse and interesting place to walkthrough and even hangout in. When I say "interesting" I speak with duality and ambivalence as I have witnessed; an hour-long police standoff with alleged drug dealers and twin babies being born in a park with nearly everyone assisting in some way. Tip of the iceberg as far experience goes but here's the rundown. <p>

      Now that things are set up let me begin telling this tale. I've been commuting to Brooklyn from the Bronx for roughly one year for the purpose of work. An hour and a half journey coming and add another 20 minutes on the return, not too bad for a solid bi-weekly check plus I managed pick a solid <a href="toomuch.html">chick</a>. Anyway, after my shift ended I had to walk three long and obscure blocks with abandoned and tattered buildings that hosted legions of stray cats and hobos. The decision of walking in the middle of the street was a choice I made and a safe one in fact. After an uncomfortable 5 minute walk the lights of the subway would greet me and the discomfort left instantaneously. </p>

      <p> However, on this night it seems the subway lights had a guest, a man with a familiar face and it seemed like he was waiting there for a long time. Hey Travern. How was worked? The stranger asked. He suddenly laughed and ran the other direction as quickly as I could blink. That was potentially last time I had ever saw him. But ever since then an uneasy feeling creeps over me as I navigate through those long blocks and make my way home.
