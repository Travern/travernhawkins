    <h3>Interesting and outright insane tales from some guy named Travern.</h3>
    <div id="intro">
      <p>Life is like a box of chocolate. A popular phrase I came across, doing some rushed last minute reading for a class feelings of hatred can't even describe. "That sucks" thinking to myself as I am a fruit snack type of guy. What if you allergic? Or have sensitive teeth or just don't like chocolate? Minor problems? I know but sometimes life throws things at you that you can't <!-- Add links to the words to send to specific pages -->foresee, comprehend, or even believe. A story is a great way, if not the greatest method to entertain someone, control one´s emotions and possibly create alterations in the mind. Throughout my 20 plus years on the planet, I´ve been fortunate (cursed) to experience and be catapulted in shocking situations; constantly leaving me scratching my head.  Like reptiles popping out vending machines, exes sneaking in your house to watch you sleep, creepy and noisy neighbors who seem to be everywhere you are regardless of time, and strangers you´ve never met knowing everything about you. Interested Yet? You shouldn't be as I haven't attempted to captivate you with my oh-so thrilling tales. However, you should be a little urious as to what can possibly leave a stubborn and often irresponsible young man perplexed.</p></div>

<h2>A Sneak Peak!</h2>
<p> A few years back while walking home from a late night shift out in industrial Brooklyn, I was greeted by a man; by name. "Hey Man" I said briefly and rudely brushed him off to catch the last train headed uptown to the Bronx. So what? I know that´s what you’re thinking. Problem is I don’t remember him… all (I have great memory; especially w/ faces). The bigger issue is that, he called me by my government name which no one; not even my parents use to address me.  Perhaps we met at a sporting event, school or maybe our paths crossed when I was attempting to pull off one of my shenanigans. Yeah that´s it as I mumbled to myself that seemed to be the only logical option I could think of. 
Place: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gowanus,_Brooklyn"> Gowanus, Brooklyn</a>, Time: Weekend <sup>(2nd Shift)</sup>, Why: Money, needed a second job because NYC is hella expensive for a millennial in the his early 20´s. The Gowanus neighborhood is a very diverse and interesting place to walkthrough and even hangout in. When I say "interesting" I speak with duality and ambivalence as I have witnessed; an hour-long police standoff with alleged drug dealers and twin babies being born in a park with nearly everyone assisting in some way. Tip of the iceberg as far experience goes but here´s the rundown.

Now that things are set up let me begin telling this tale. I´ve been commuting to Brooklyn from the Bronx for roughly one year for the purpose of work. An hour and a half journey coming and add another 20 minutes on the return, not too bad for a solid bi-weekly check plus I managed pick a solid <a href=" toomuch.html">chick</a>. Anyway, after my shift ended I had to walk three long and obscure block with abdondonded and tattered buildings that hosted legions of stray cats and hobos. probably nearly turned out he had committed suicide. The election of walking in the middle of the street was a choice I made and a safe one in fact. After an uncomfortable 5 minute walk the lights of the subway would greet me and the discomfort left instantaneously. However, on this night it seems the subway lights had a guest, a man with a familiar face and it seemed like he was waiting there for a long time. Hey Travern. How was worked?
