          <h1>Genesis A. Wallace: December 24, 2002 - October 24, 2017 </h1>
<p>This is a dedication to my niece (via my older brother). On October 25, 2017, I received numerous texts from my father, which is rather odd as he hates any form of technology. The message read "I can't believe Gen killed herself. With dad being tech illiterate; it warranted a call from me. Then, I receive the bad news that made me nearly collapse in the middle of Manhattan. Genesis was found dead in her room around 2am by her mother and suicide was the cause. My mind then opened up to the possibilities that could of made her do such a thing. It didn't and still doesn't make sense. Genesis was confident, brash, precise, and had potiential that was through the roof. Why? What happened? Could I have done something? What was she thinking? Or feeling? Was she bullied? Abused? It had to be something that angered and shamed you to the point of logic being obsolete. For the next few days I contemplated life and thought about the what might-have-beens. </p>
<p>Shame. The feeling I felt as I wasn't man enough to call my brother for over a week. What could I say to him?  How could I console him or even relate to him (no kids). Eventually the uncomfortable call was made with me just saying I'm sorry and listening to one of the toughest men I know breakdown in tears. Frequent trips to Philadelphia to help out anyway I could followed. I then took it upon myself to contact all my nephews and nieces to extend an olive branch of communication. </p>

<p>On the day of her burial while driving from NYC to Philly, I began to reminisce. I thought about the night she was born, me babysitting her for the first time, her attachment to my brother, dancing to Beyonce's "Single Ladies", and the prank phone calls you'd just to piss me off. The funeral and burial was yesterday and I must say that was the worst experience I've ever witnesses. Seeing family cry, scream, and collapse was something new to me. But seeing my brother's tribute to his daughter was torture. I never saw my brother cry but seeing a man broken is something you can't explain. He literally collapsed and cried constantly as friends and family consoled him. I was frozen just horrified, frozen and incoherent. No much left to say. Genesis I love and I hope you truly rest in peace, however, our family will never recover our loss of you. </p>
