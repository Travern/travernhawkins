   <h2>The Hunt</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Simplicity!</strong> A word that would title my autobiography. On this particular day, while in route to my weekend warehouse gig; I spotted a very attractive, tall and black girl getting on the train. Usually, I'd glance and come up with a plan of attack and strike but I was drawing a blank. She was wearing a sweat suit and the curves her body possessed were on full display for my eyes only. The smell of vanilla overtook the car and I was now focused on the capture. Assessing the situation I noticed she didn't look happy at all in fact she look angry. What the hell is her problem I thought, doesn't look like she wants to talk or even be bothered. However, that wasn't a deterrent to me at all if anything it was more of a catalyst. As the train emptied out at the station before crossing the Brooklyn Bridge our eyes met briefly and I got the hell you looking at gaze accompanied by the eye roll. Being a natural contrarian I asked her to stop staring at me rather rudely while approaching her slowly: catching her off guard. Insults of me being ugly, not worth staring at and "How do you know what am staring at you if you're not staring at me" echoed from her mouth. I simply replied "so what if I'm staring at you, I like what I see". She smile and I went back to stating the job was done. To my surprise she actually came to sit next to me and a conversation began. While conversing I learned she was from the islands, had lost her mother and father on her birthday.... one year apart. Numbers exchanged, hugs were given and promises of a future meet up were on the horizon. As we parted she asked me if she I thought she was crazy, out of the ordinary. No thinking and being filled with ego I responded "No, I'm just that good" with hindsight being 20/20, No I am not that good and yes she was crazy.

    <h2>Erecting of Flags</h2>
<p>Confidence to be honest, Arrogance! My sentiments of the "heist" I just pulled off. Phone calls and texts were exchanged, no dates however as our schedules constantly clashed, to my displeasure. Nevertheless, I enjoyed conversations as they revealed how similar our background were. Both the youngest, parents from the islands, great relationships with a grandparent (mom for me, dad for her), aspirations to have a traditional nuclear family, a love for sports, and most importantly our affinity for showering food in ketchup and barbeque sauce. The excitement waiting for an incoming phone from this girl felt like someone broke waiting on their check. Getting to know each other felt almost like a privilege, hours would flyby when we conversed. Laughter often flooded the phone lines at sharing of some of my <a href="index.html">escapades</a>. Thoughts of the face of face often crossed my mind as we seem to relate to each other much like long lost friends and that was just over the phone. Intentions to me to meet were mutually shared so was the anxiety aka thirst. Oh yeah; from this point on, the noun the chick, or pronouns like her and she will be a replacement to describe my girlfriend of the past. </p>
<p> 
 Fast-forward a few weeks later and now we have a date. The plan was to spend the entire day together (her idea) and navigate the streets of New York City. Spring had just arrived and on this day the weather was absolutely gorgeous, women walking around half-naked everywhere. On the agenda was an outing to a food festival, a friendly game of bowling, a voyage on a ferry going around Manhattan, an excursion to Lincoln Square for a small amateur concert, and topped off by a trip to the movies to see 42: Jackie Robinson Biopic. Sounds fun. Right? Anyway the rendezvous was a rather smooth transition and talks of our future daily endeavor ensued. First up was a food truck festival out in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Great time but my companion had a minor dispute with a child over the fact of line cutting, costing her the opportunity to dine on a chocolate custard. Next up was a trip to the bowling alley which was rather mediocre but the competitive nature in the air kept things interesting. Sadly, the intended ferry around Manhattan was missed due the bowling game going overboard. However, the substitute was to people watch in Central Park. Then... things take a turn, for the worst. We joked about the appearance of people who had the displeasure of entering our realm.
</p>
<p> 
 Unfortunately the jokes began to turn into an onslaught of hurtful insults. Normally, my acquired taste for insulting wouldn't be too troublesome (yeah, I'm a jackass) but the things coming out of this chick's mouth felt.... evil. Talk about being out of line insulting old people with medical conditions, children with deformities, odd looking couples, and not even amputees veterans were not off limits. Things got very uncomfortable however, I stuck to my aces and flipped the script on her, insulting her rather harshly. As it horrible as this sounds the more anger I saw coming from her, the more comfortable I felt. Eventually, things got old somewhat quick but an apology or sentiments of regret never came from her. A stroll to Lincoln Square commenced as did a very tense conversation as we were both walking on egg shells. On arrival my attention was captivated by a quartet of very exotic looking dancers from the Caribbean. Coordinated, stylish, and skilled are the best adjectives that clearly defined their appearance and performance. Impressed, I didn't really pay attention to the other performers or even my date as she seemed to be with my instance of finding out more info about the aforementioned dancers, jealousy? Maybe? At least I think so. Why? Demands to leave were made even though she scheduled us to be there. My reply "No! This was your idea and I'm actually having fun. Don't you like having fun"? That anger face made another appearance and it was accompanied cold long silence lasting all the way to the movie showing. </p>
<p> What an experience. From the audience interaction, storyline, and the actors performances everything was clicking. Screams, rants, ad-libs, cries, and laughter all filled the theatre. So what wrong? Could you believe this chick fell asleep? Adding insult to injury she finished the nachos and popcorn. </p>

    <h2>Crazy is...</h2>
    <p> this was the guillotine cutting of the head for me. The decision to be a decent human being and d gentleman was made so I walked her back to the train station out of pure obligation. A little small talk here and there but nothing to warrant a second date. Puzzled, I thought to myself why things weren't adding up. The conversation on the phone was great, we both like what we saw, but the face to face and chemistry wasn't there. Define mediocrity. Then.... here comes a lifeline. A promise of a better date, an explanation for a terrible week, and a very passionate kissed sealed the deal. Frequent messages were text to phone inquiring about my safe return home, which I had intention return. However, sleep go the best and my anticipated responses never came in time. As I played catch up the next day the texts got more and authoritative, invoking memories of my boot camp instructor. During the return call, we reach a compromise briefly, turns out she thought I was deliberately being a jackass after the previous night. </p>
<p> the second meetup was perfect. Everything was there chemistry, body language, and conversation. Everything! To keep thing PG, great thing happened afterwards. Months ensued and a rather suave transition took place. A Helicopter ride around Manhattan, romantic lunches, picnics, trips to the beach, clubbing, BBQ's, concerts, and even went to the gym together. Good times, Imagine that. Sadly, those times wouldn't last. Personalities would often clash and the relationship was in constant jeopardy. The speed bumps often hit were heated arguments, lateness, phone checking, unannounced appearances, wild accusations, insecurity and much more. Eventually feelings of obligation and dread arrived, having no intention to depart. </p>

<h2>From Heaven to Hell</h2>
<p> The cat and mouse game continued for a few more months. Picture Tom & Jerry or the Road Runner and Willie E. Coyote, yeah that bad. The Breaking point was reached on a chilly fall day, possibly one of the worst days in my life. My demise began earlier the day before. Having the pleasure of playing taxi drive/mover for this chick, I spent the entire night helping her pack and move neglecting to get the proper rest. Once home, I had even more trouble falling asleep. Now the snowball effect begins; lateness, reprimand, underperforming, and eventually passing out; injuring the left side of my face. Rushed to the ER my injuries thank heaven, were not too serious after 6 hour of MRI's, EKG's and every other test known to man. Making the situation worse, I noticed I left my phone and iPod at the job site so no direct contacts. After being released I took the train home with people staring in my face wonder, who the hell beat me up. Later that night I happened to be hosting a small boxing party (bad idea, I know) with bets being made. To cut things short I losing a lot of money that night and was banking on the main even to at least break even.    </p>
<p>The main event would have to wait. I heard keys opening the door and standing in the doorway was an angry looking woman. Before I could even open my mouth screams and all types of profanities came my way. Never had I seen such anger come from one person, eventually I had enough of her and told her to leave. Bad move. Next thing I know is a coffee cup flying at my face and me barley ducking. She then went for heavier artillery and attempted to do a number on me. Luckily, my friends apprehended and escorted her out the building. That very night locks were changed and every attempt to remove traces of her from my life, she also broke my TV too. </p>
    <img src="images/Marek-Bernat.jpg">
<p> for the next few days I tried to rebound from such a crappy day, opting to stay home watching romantic comedies. I guess it worked and I began to not loath the world for simply giving me a turn in being screwed. Heading back to work I got back into the groove of things. My face was healing, TV was fixed, picked up a new phone and iPod, started going out again, and was just ready to get back on track. The train was nearly derailed when I got home and saw this chick cooking in my kitchen, acting as if nothing ever happened. I immediately ran out to get my neighbor as a witness and had her call the cops for my safety. Of course more insult were thrown at me as she left, but the uncomfortable feeling of she got in worried me more. Had she been here before and left before I arrived? Did she take anything of value? Did she leave something that would leave me in jail? No one let her in. Not the super, handyman or workers in the management office. The locks weren't tampered or anything, so I changed the locks again.   
He nail in the coffin was me coming home three weeks later to a destroyed and flooded apartment. Clothes? Cut up/ TV? Smashed. Jewelry? In the toilet bowl. Cops called again and couldn't prove exactly who had done the deed. As this was just word or mouth or hearsay. "Time to go" I said to myself, immediately packing up and being on my way. I moved back to home to the dismay of my parents. </p>

<h2>What did I Learn? </h2>
<p>Depression and Instability. The words that best define my life over the course of the next few months. I mean instability and depression as showing late to work consistently, failing out of school, getting fat, lacking focus, discipline, and even confidence. After months of watching me whine like a little child my father finally gave me the verbal ass kicking I truly needed and deserved. After an hour of berating I and questioning his paternity on me got the picture. It took me  some time to get the ball rolling but i guess I'll chalk this one up to being young, stupid, in love, and controlled by emotion, As a confession I do look her up (looks GOOD) online from time to time and really do think about "sliding in her DM's". With all that said I learned... NOTHING. </p>
