  <h2>Setting the Scene </h2>
<p> Growing up in a large family while being the youngest, simply prepares you for a lifetime of never being a priority. Birthdays are forgotten, special events missed and hand-me-downs are your only choice of fashion. To the average kid these things tend to have a profound negative effect. However, to some like me this was an opportunity, this was heaven. Why? The simple fact I could do almost whatever I wanted. Having 5 brothers and 2 sisters at various stages of life often occupied the time of my parents. With that much room to maneuver my shenanigans began to get more daring.  As a toddler innovation, foresight and toughness were skills that had to be learned and executed. The constant bullying, beat downs and torture at the hands of my siblings made the inevitable. Nevertheless I just saw it as a necessary evil and a great trade off. Being able to light rooftop firework during the winter, come home late consistently, cut school, fight, and always be on the radar of the truancy cops was a good trade. Even when punished I felt like I cheated the system. Grounding gave me the time to use my overactive imagination and perfect the chinks in my armor. Chores just allowed me to have more time later as there was no work to be done. Beatings were just an uncomfortable few minutes of pain which tended to alleviate much quickly as I grew. </p>
<p>Eventually, my dad thought it was just a phase all the men in our must go through to be better men. Besides they had bills to pay and many other problems to deal with. All of their children were transition into different stages in life. They a daughter going off to college, a son enlisting in the military, one son entering a marriage, another moving out the country, and a daughter on the verge of being a mother. Clearly, you can see figure out how much quickly I figured out how occupied their time was. The good that came from his was the time spent with my grandmother who had all the time, love, and experience to nurture me. However, my misdeeds would eventually manifest themselves and would have to be dealt with. </p>
<h3>Some Explaining to do</h3>
     <p>
      Why? Simply put i was nice to her and actually enjoyed being in her presence. The real reasoning was actually witnessing her hurt by her husband death and seeing her in that state made me feel uncomfortable and sad. Even as I child I knew she wouldn't be the same person; her children have moved on with their lives, loneliness (grandpa had that game), and regret wishing she had done more to be a better mom. All my siblings had things going on relationships, college, jobs, and even families so grandma wasn't a priority. Out of pure guilt I would call her three time a week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday), accompany her for church every Sunday, and one Saturday a month gardening or breakfast was on the menu. Eventually a strong bond grew and she trusted me enough to give me dirt on my mom and the keys to her apartment when things got rough around the house. "Mom you'll never guess what Travis did" was never believed by Granny when my mom made the insistence on my wrong doing. Why would she? I had 5 older brothers; 2 who got in trouble with the law, 1 who as a misogynist and 2 others that never sought out a relationship with her. According to her I was the golden child not to mention I was a good student so my report card was kind of an alibi so to speak. 
      </p>
<h3>Let's Go Deeper</h3>
    <p>Boundaries began to be pushed (by yours truly) and the mom began to get sick and tired of always hearing (never saw me do anything) about something she "knew" I did. Enough was enough but arrogance wouldn't let that fact set in my head. If things hit the fan I'll just go live with grandma I thought to myself. She LOVES me, she won't be alone, I'll be well behaved, and it would make my family sick to their stomachs. With that plan waiting to be hatched in the mind I became very reckless, to make the story short I was caught trying to sneak a girl in the bathroom on a dare (remember truth or dare) and was suspended for a week. Confused at why everyone was angry situation, I simply asked the question "What is wrong with sneaking a girl that you like into the Bathroom?" A burst of laughter from my guidance counselor (a man) and the sickening silence filled the room. Simultaneously being interviewed the girl I snuck in the bathroom said she wasn't a willingly participant (later recanted) and all hell breaks loose. Guarantees of an arrest and assault charges were being assured to me at that time, an investigation and an indefinite suspension (mentioned above 1 week) followed. I was conditioned for the common routine when I pissed of the old lady. </p>
<h3>The Routine</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Threats</li>
      <li>Call to Dad</li>
      <li>Beating</li>
      <li> Repossession (of my favorite thing) </li>
      <li>Chores</li>
      <li>Length of Punishment </li>
      <li>Call to Grandma (preference)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>And Repeat</h3>
    <p>
      However, this day was different. There was no yelling, no ducking or dodging attempted slaps, no menacing stares, or even anger on her face. In fact she took me to McDonalds and bought me a MCFlurry (cookie and cream; won't forget that) eventually arriving home as a fine dining experience. That more like I said to myself she should know by now. I was later asked to go have fun outside so I took upon myself to go tell grandma my side of things. As I narrated my previous endeavor my granny laughed and told me I should have waited after class to pull off such a daring stunt. As I concluded the tale I asked if he daughter had called her yet to tell her the good new but no was the response the game out her mouth. Good. Right? I asked. Not good she warned me when "your mother's not yelling something is wrong".</p> <p>We ate dinner trying to figure out what the hell this woman was up to but nothing made sense to me. Bidding her farewell with a kiss on the cheek and hug I went home to try and crack this case. Upon entering the vestibule of my apartment build a man in an army uniform came out of the elevator smiling on as he just accomplished something unattainable. He greeted me as we cross path but being ill-mannered may I dare say rude the greeting was no reciprocated. "Travis we have a busy day tomorrow so get some sleep" was told to me while opening the door, whatever I said under my breath. Lying on the bed; pondering about the occurrences that passed during the day, the thought "there's nothing she can do to me that she hasn't done before in some capacity".  A misfire on my behalf, F that it was more of a backfire! </p>

      <h3>DEAD WRONG (Trav - You're Dead Wrong)</h3>
    <p> the smell eggs, bacon, and porridge (yes porridge) awoke me in the early morning. Good News? Nope. Why? Two Reasons. Mom never cooked and my steady streak of dining with the Trix Rabbit, Count Chocula, Frank Berry, and Lucky the Leprechaun quartet was over. I thanked her for the well-prepared and began the preparation (mentally and physically) of spending the day with this woman. </p>
  <p>First Stop. The doctor's office; Check-ups and immunization. Not too bad. But in hindsight mom was just fattening up the pig for the slaughterhouse. Next; downtown to the city to obtain document and Id's. Too my joy, I was given the opportunity to not experience with soul sucking and time wasting process with the opportunity to play basketball. For the entire afternoon I was blinded by the combination of completion, creativity, and overall fun took over my mind. Every dribble and jump shot taken me of all eased my brain and all was forgotten.... until she showed up to get me. Hindsight activated I was served my last meal, Simple and Plain. Left to the wolves, feed to the dogs, marooned, setup and other saying you can think of. The time spent playing basketball on my behalf was used to sign me up to three different camps (one a boot camp). </p>  
  <p> Anyway, after the pickup we had Chinese food and went home without much conversation. Perhaps she knew that boys particularly her sons are totally idiots coming up and grow out of the nonsense. After all this wasn't her first time around the block, I prayed to myself. 8 weeks to be exact elapsed without incident and the upcoming summer was mine for the taking or so I foolishly thought. On the last day of school; I arrived home to four men dressed in camouflage army gear holding luggage belonging to me yours truly. "Take Him" said a very sadistic and familiar voice, my mother entered the room and then stepped out just as quickly as if discarding an unwanted piece of old furniture. Without much fight I laughed. What were they gonna do? Beat me up? Threats? Manual Labor? Insults? It's all been done and I sadly I've built up the immunity. Knowing that; a smug arrogance coated me as I dared to confront this hell-hole boot camp in upstate New York.
  </p>
  <h2>Involuntary Vending</h2>
<p>Six hours. A six hour trip to be tortured <!-- cross out discipline -->(disciplined) on a funky charter bus. To be honest; that was the worst of the trip. I thoroughly enjoyed the companionship of my fellow "convicts"; entertaining me with daring tales of high-speed chases, grueling brawls, theoretical bank robberies, and daring drug deals. Concern was the last thing on my mind as not one person displayed such sentiments. Laughter and intrigue (even the bus driver was laughing) came to a complete halt when we arrive at in a barren and deserted wasteland. <br> "Sh#t! We have to live here for the next month?" yelled a fellow Conrad. Not even a second later a bald and short white man came aboard and simple smiled. I know that smile; I saw it on the face of my brothers and bullies who picked on me. It was the smirk of figuring out what was the best/worst way to inflict punishment. Being an analogy analyst; picture a hungry fox infiltrating a hen house, a hen house full of dozens of fat and juicy hens. Yeah, like that. We were escorted of the bus and lead to open field/obstacle course to be oriented. Surprisingly, there was no yelling, demand for exercise, forced haircuts or any other idea you and I can conjure up. The dining wasn't too bad, expected slop got dried chicken breast and baked potatoes with the stale tasting salad. Only con, one cup of water had to last with your meal. Something I was told after the fact. </p>
<p>
However, we were allowed to buy snacks and drinks from vending machines located in the front of the dining hall. Great, Right? I can buy snacks at will, potential sell them to make a profit and have a small piece of my humanity. Upon approach the machines looked unkempt and old, investigating even further the snacks looked dated. Candy bars covered in dust, Twinkies and Ho Hos shriveled up, and the interior lights were broken all but one. Well that sucks, just needed a drink anyway. Placing the quarters in the machine (4), turning the knob and waiting for my beverage to appear seemed to be current plan I was employing. And... Nothing. A few violent shakes and profanity followed due the alleged one-sided transactions. I reached into the depository of the machine with intention of grabbing my god-damn water and a snake head popped out scaring the life out of me. It jumped out violently, as if I disturbed it from resting. I ran and told my drill instructor about the uncommon occurrence and nothing was said, simply that eerie smile was displayed for me to see. </p>
 <h2>My Deer</h2>
<p>Now. If you though the "snake in the box" trick was a warning sign, just call it the opening act. The next morning the troops (name I gave us) were awoken by loud sirens nearly identical to those of the police. "The Honeymoon is Over" said our drill instructor, "I'm gonna work you until you love it". He then give us the daily layout of what was expected of us. </p>

<h4>This was Daily. Weekends Included.</h4>  
<img src="images/130722-M-FS592-088.JPG">
<p> As it began, the grueling daily process of running, cleaning, talking to old people, eating mediocre cuisine, provision of manual labor became a hindrance. The consistency, intensity and attention to detail would slowly but surely get to me I wasn't used to being under fire for that long and I think my Sergeant knew that. Next up was a 3 day camping test, basically a small mission. A small platoon of three had to work together to survive and make it back to base safely. What a nightmare! We struggled to catch any fish much less make a tent. On the 2nd morning I woke up to a deer leering at me directly in front of the tent. After the third day, anticipation to return to base overcame all of us. But failing grades forced us to return to the woods while heavy rains choose to accompany on the second go around. Define horrible. With one week left, late night runs were an order and even more community service was thrusted upon us. At the closing ceremony our drill sergeant told us he would be praying we mess up, so he can host us again, possibly for the whole summer.</p>
<h2>A Breath of Fresh Air</h2>
<p>Not even a day back home and I'm on a bus headed back into the wilderness. This time the FRESH AIR FUND, a foundation that provides camping experiences for the inner-city youth. 14 days of more nature didn't do much to enthuse me but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It felt like a band of brothers, all being tied to the harsh realities of the inner city.   No shouting, screams, demands, or threats ever surfaced. The gorgeous summer days flew by with friendly football games, trips to the farm and planetarium, talent shows, hikes and even a dinner to send us off. Currently, I still remember and cherish the experience; to the point that I know all the names of my counselors and campmates. </p>

<h2> F'in Florida </h2>
<p>As I arrived home another surprise trip awaited me. This time my destination was to Florida with the company of my dear old dad. The flight was roughly two and a half hours, with turbulent winds that made seriously consider death as a certainty. Florida, the land of flowers and the haven of retirement, relaxation, and recovery. I felt the opposite of those such things. Bitter work was everywhere and it seemed to want me to do it. The only good that came from this was meeting my father's family and his ex-wife V. For the next week I had to help my brother's girlfriend setup and breakdown inflatable playpens all over Central Florida. The heat only made things worse as I truly got the slavery experience. </p>
    <p> The Floridian fauna also wanted to introduce themselves in the form of alligators and snakes. I was surprised how quickly and quietly they could maneuver without noise or detection. My other mandates were painting houses, cleaning pools, removing a wasp nest and mowing lawns. Lesson learned. If these were the consequences of my troubles, I'm taking the high road. From then on, I kept a low profile and never got caught again. That's what I learned and yes the rebelliousness is still there. </p>
